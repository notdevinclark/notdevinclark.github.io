							<h2>About Me</h2>
						</header>
						<p>
							Hello there, my name is Devin Clark and I am Senior Software Engineer that has a passion for learning new technologies and exploring efficient solutions to complex problems.
							<br />
							<br />
							I have been writing software professionally for the last 12 years, primarily working with Ruby and Ruby on Rails. Throughout my career I have done frontend work with Javascript, React, and CSS with backend work using Ruby, Java, Kafka, GraphQL with a smattering of different databases like MySql and Postgres. In my spare time I have been diving more into Java as well as Elixir, Python, and Machine Learning.
							<br />
							<br />
							I love software development’s ever changing landscape of new ideas and approaches to solving different problems. I never want to be held back by the phrase “We have always done it this way!".
							<br />
							<br />
							Outside of tech, you will find me spending time with my corgi Maple, out on a trail or if I am lucky, walking on the beach. And when the weather does not allow that, you can find me hosting a game of Dungeons & Dragons as a DM or playing video games.
							<br />
							<br />
							If you share my passion for well written, efficient software and like to think outside the box, I would love to connect. Feel free to reach out to me on LinkedIn.
